# ud036_StarterCode

This project was built for learning purposes. It uses the OMDB Api to get
information about a certain movie. In this project I test 6 movies to create
a webpage to show the Title of the movie, the Poster and the Youtube Trailer.

## Getting Started

To try this project you need to follow the installing section. After that just
run the entertainment_center.py to generate the HTML with my favorite movies.

### Installing

You gonna need two python libraries to run this project:
The requests library you can install using the following pip command
```
pip install requests
```

And the BeautifulSoup library
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```


## Built With

* [Requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) - To get data from API's
